# TSS-Clubs
‚≠êA cross-platform app that organizes and advertises clubs at Thornhill Secondary School.

Thornhill Secondary School, the high school that I currently go to, offers a wide range of different clubs that students can attend and explore their interests in. However, students often don't know about many of these clubs and how to join them, which is why I'm developing an app that organizes all of these clubs and provides students with everything that they need to know about each club (e.g. club description, meeting rooms, images, ect.). 

# ‚úÖProgress

The development of the app is done. Now every single club must be added with the correct info so that the app can be released on the App store and Google play.

üóíÔ∏èNote: This repository does not contain all files required to test this app, as some of them should remain private. The app will be accessible whenever it is released 
on the AppStore and Google Play.
