⭐A cross-platform app I'm developing that organizes and advertises clubs at Thornhill Secondary School.

Thornhill Secondary School, the high school that I currently go to, offers a wide range of different clubs that students can attend and explore their interests in. However, students often don't know about many of these clubs and how to join them, which is why I'm developing an app that organizes all of these clubs and provides students with everything that they need to know about each club (e.g. club description, meeting rooms, images, ect.). 

# ✅Progress

Most of the app is done, the core organizing and admin features have been finished. Right now I'm working on improving the UI and optimizing the app.
